# E-Commerce Website Redesign

## Project Overview

Acme Outdoor Gear approached me to redesign their outdated e-commerce website. The primary goals were to improve the user experience, increase mobile conversions, and modernize the visual design while maintaining their brand identity.

## Challenges

- The existing site had poor mobile performance with high bounce rates
- The checkout process was complicated and led to cart abandonment
- Product categorization was confusing for customers
- The site lacked modern features like wishlist and quick view

## Solutions

### Responsive Design

I implemented a fully responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices. Special attention was given to the mobile shopping experience, with easy-to-use filters and a streamlined checkout process.

### Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Example of image optimization implementation
const optimizeImages = async (images) => {
  return Promise.all(
    images.map(async (image) => {
      const optimized = await imageProcessor.resize({
        width: 800,
        format: 'webp',
        quality: 85
      });
      return optimized;
    })
  );
};
```

The site was built with performance in mind, achieving a 95+ PageSpeed score on both mobile and desktop.

### Improved Navigation

The new navigation system was designed based on user research, with clear categories and an intuitive search function that provides instant results.

### Streamlined Checkout

The checkout process was reduced from 5 steps to 3, with a progress indicator and the ability to check out as a guest. This resulted in a 24% decrease in cart abandonment.

## Results

- 37% increase in mobile conversions
- 42% increase in average time on site
- 24% decrease in cart abandonment rate
- 18% increase in average order value

## Technologies Used

The site was built using SvelteKit for the frontend, with TailwindCSS for styling. The backend uses PostgreSQL for data storage, and the Stripe API for payment processing. The site is fully responsive and achieves excellent performance metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a thoughtful redesign with a focus on user experience can significantly impact business metrics. By understanding the customer journey and optimizing key conversion points, we were able to create a website that not only looks modern but also performs exceptionally well.
